                <p>I was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Yup, my family came over on the Mayflower and landed on Plymouth Rock
                    in 1620. Who knows, that last part could be true. My parents moved to South Texas when I was about five
                    so I guess that really makes me a Texan. Growing up in Corpus Christi wasn't all that exciting. The city
                    is best known for the beaches and Selena (google her).</p>
                <p>I have my Bachelor's degree in Business and my Master's degree in Human Resource Management. For the past
                    six years, I have worked for an international adoption agency. We currently faciliate adoptions from
                    Bulgaria, Burundi, China, Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Latvia. We also have orphan hosting and student
                    exchange programs. The work is very rewarding but definitely takes it's toll on a person after a while</p>
                <p>Some of my interest/hobbies are: playing golfing, craft beers, and pretty much watching any type of sports.
                    I'm recently trying to be more classy so I've taken an interest in cigars and whiskey.</p>
